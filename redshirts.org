   Interns for the industry!

   To boldly go!
   
   A simple, little web application to manage the requirements for completing student internships.
   
** foundation
   In the course of "Managing Technical Teams" during Winter Quarter 2012 at the Univesity of Washington, Tacoma, a small group formed to automate the existing "paper" process followed by students, faculty advisors, industry sponsors and administrative staff to complete internships.
   
** considerations
   This application is intended to be the [[http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest.html]["simplest thing that could possibly work"]]
   
** resources
   - install node.js and postgres
   - git clone this repo
   - cd redshirts
   - npm install
   - build the database (with script that will be provided)
   - (at the command line) node app.js

** implementation
   - [X] create repo on git hub
   - [ ] refactor participant requests to new page
   - [ ] send request to sponsor/advisor (nodemailer)
   - [ ] accept request
   - [ ] list activities and crud
   - [ ] email reminders for upcoming scheduled activities
   - [ ] generate report (pdf?)
